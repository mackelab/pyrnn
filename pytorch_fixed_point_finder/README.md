# Pytorch FixedPointFinder - A Pytorch toolbox for finding fixed points and linearized dynamics in recurrent neural networks

Finds and analyzes the fixed points of recurrent neural networks that have been built using Tensorflow. The approach follows that outlined in Sussillo and Barak (2013), "Opening the Black Box: Low-Dimensional Dynamics in High-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks", *Neural Computation*.

Written for Python 3.9

This is a modified version of [the orginal fixed point finder toolbox](https://github.com/mattgolub/fixed-point-finder/blob/master/FixedPoints.py) written by Matt Golub
